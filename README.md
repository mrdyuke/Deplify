## About the project

Hello to everyone who reads this text!

This is a **small educational project** created to explore the basic syntax of the Go programming language and several parts of the Go standard library.

The project was designed with **simplicity in mind** and intentionally avoids unnecessary abstractions or advanced CLI features.

> This repository is not intended to be a production-ready tool.  
> Its main purpose is **learning and experimentation**.

At the moment, **further development is not planned**.

To use this project, you need **one** of the following:

- **Go installed on your system [Download Golang](https://go.dev/dl/)**

**OR**

 - **A precompiled binary for your operating system from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mrdyuke/deplify/releases)**

You can verify that Go is installed by running:

3. Add the binary to your system `PATH`

Once this is done, the program can be executed directly:
